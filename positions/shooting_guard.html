        <p> The <em><strong>shooting guard (SG)</strong></em>, also known as the two, two guard or off guard,[1] is one of the five traditional positions in a regulated basketball game. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for their team and steal the ball on defense. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6' 2" (1.88 m) to 6' 6” (1.98 m) while in the WNBA, shooting guards tend to be between 5' 10" (1.78 m) to 6' 1" (1.85 m).  </p>
    
        <p>The Basketball Handbook by Lee Rose describes a shooting guard as a player whose primary role is to score points. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are good long-range shooters, typically averaging 35–40 percent from three-point range. Many shooting guards are also strong and athletic, and have the ability to get inside the paint and drive to the basket. </p>
        <h3>Qualities</h3>
        <p>Shooting guards generally are well-versed scorers. They should be able to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Slash to the basket</li>
            <li>Handle the ball</li>
            <li>Shooting</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Under the basket</li>
                    <li>Three-Point</li>
                    <li>Mid-range</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Shooting Guards in the NBA</h3>
        <p>Shooting guards must be able to score in various ways, especially late in a close game when defenses are tighter. They need to have a good free throw percentage too, to be reliable in close games and to discourage opposing players from fouling. Because of the high level of offensive skills shooting guards need, they are often a team's primary scoring option, and sometimes the offense is built around them.</p>

        <p>In the NBA, there are some shooting guards referred to as "3 and D" players. The term 3 and D implies that the player is a good 3 point shooter who can also play solid (sometimes elite) defense. The 3 and D player has become very important as the game sways to be perimeter oriented</p>

        <p>Good shooting guards can often play point guard to a certain extent. It is usually accepted that point guards should have the ball in their hands at most times in the game, but sometimes the shooting guard has a significant enough influence on the team where they handle the ball extremely often, to the point where the point guard may be reduced to a backup ball handler or spot-up shooter. Notable shooting guards include Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Dwyane Wade, Clyde Drexler, Jerry West, George Gervin and Allen Iverson.</p>
